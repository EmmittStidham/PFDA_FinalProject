## Description
This Program uses the pygame and random libraries to generate a random maze, which the user can interact with. The user starts
in the top left corner of the maze as a green square and can navigate the maze with the arrow keys to reach the end of the
maze at the bottom right corner. Before the game starts the user will input their name and once it is finished a message displaying how much time they took to complete it, their score and their name will be sent to the terminal.
